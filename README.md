<h2 align="center">ðŸŒ± Who am I?</h2>


I am a dedicated, detail-oriented, and reliable person, who believes to find a common language with everyone. 
As I enjoy learning and problem-solving, I decided to develop my skillset further in the data analytics field. Therefore, I have gained experience in <strong>SQL, MySQL, Data Visualization, Python, Tableau, Machine Learning, and more</strong>. Whilst developing my knowledge in these areas, I have finished many projects that progressed me to thrive within the data analytics field, also from a professional standpoint.

The magic happens thanks to a database of 10,000 songs (collected by Spotify API & Webscrapping) and an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm (K-means clustering).
